# disableclicks
This short & sweet JS will automatically disable and enable clicks for you.<br />
How to activate: (All parameters are optional.)<br />
`clicks.disable([id]);`<br />
If you don't pass any arguments, the id of the resulting element will automatically default to "clicks". <br />
To re-enable them: <br />
`clicks.enable();` <br />
That's about it.
