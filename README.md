# disableclicks
This short + sweet JS will automatically disable and enable clicks for you.<br />
Oh, by the way, you can use either min.js or the regular .js file to use this script. I prefer the min.js, but it's not my choice. Your website, you can do what you want... xD <br />
How to activate: (All parameters are optional.) <br />
`disableClicks([id of the resulting element]);`<br />
If you don't pass any arguments, the id of the resulting element will automatically default to "takingClicks". <br />
To re-enable them (uses localStorage):<br />
`enableClicks();`<br />
All browsers with localStorage support should support this. <br />
Aight peace
