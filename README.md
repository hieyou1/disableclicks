# disableclicks
This short + sweet JS will automatically disable and enable clicks for you.<br />
Oh, by the way, you can use either min.js or the regular .js file to use this script. I prefer the min.js, but it's not my choice. Your website, you can do what you want... xD <br />
How to activate: (All parameters are optional.) \[If you want legacy support, set the last value to true.\]<br />
`disableClicks([id of the resulting element], [avoid using localStorage]);`<br />
If you don't pass any arguments, the id of the resulting element will automatically default to "takingClicks". <br />
To re-enable them (uses localStorage unless you pass it your olid): <br />
`enableClicks([your olid if you aren't using localStorage]);`<br />
All modern browsers should support this. Idk how to check <br />
Aight peace
