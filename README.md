# disableclicks
This short + sweet JS will automatically disable and enable clicks for you. How to activate: (All parameters are optional.)<br />
`disableClicks([id of the resulting element]);`<br />
To re-enable them (uses localStorage):<br />
`enableClicks();`<br />
All browsers with localStorage support should support this. <br />
Aight peace
